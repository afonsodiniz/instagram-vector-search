1001,"Smokey Breaded Aubergine with Tomato and Burrata - Another Day In Paradise
This is basically an aubergine/eggplant parmesan - a classic I have love for but don't really get down with these days. I usually want it to taste more like aubergine, with a bit of crunch, and have something bright and acidic to cut through it beyond the tomato sauce.",CAROUSEL_ALBUM,https://instagram.com/p/mock1001,2024-04-27T16:58:08.934638,2445,97,"aubergine,eggplant,burrata,recipe,vegetarian","aubergine,flour,breadcrumbs,egg,milk,tomatoes,shallot,garlic,basil,burrata"
1002,"Spicy Carottes Râpées, and Chicken With Pan Sauce - Another Day In Paradise
I love the classic French shredded carrot salad, and highly recommend you have it in your back pocket if you don't already. This version is not the classic, but still hits a lot of the same notes.",IMAGE,https://instagram.com/p/mock1002,2025-01-17T16:58:08.934669,686,130,"french,carrots,chicken,recipe,pansauce","carrots,chicken,herbs,vinegar"

I've been throwing stuff in my rice cooker to see what happens since I've had one - this combo is my favourite so far. Always with something fresh and pickled near by.",CAROUSEL_ALBUM,https://instagram.com/p/mock1004,2024-07-03T16:58:08.934675,2960,45,"porkbelly,rice,ricecooker,asian","pork belly,sushi rice,ginger,garlic,soy sauce,sesame oil"
